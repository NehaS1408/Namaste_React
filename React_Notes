what is crossorigin used in importing the files.

NPM:- is standard repository for all the packages, it's bigest package manager.
any package we need in our project we can use it.

Package.JSON:- it's configuration for npm, it's keep tracking of the version of all the packages installed in our application

package-lock.JSON:- it locks the vesrion ans keeps the record of the every/exact version of package/dependency

what is bundler:-
it's bundle your app, packages your app so that it can be shipped to the production

there are types of dependency we can install
1) Dev dependency :- it required at the development phase
2)Normal dependency :- used in production also

what is caret and tilde in package.JOSN
caret:- it will update automatically the minor version of the packages.
tilde:- it will update the major version automatically

we can bring react to our project via two ways:-
CDN Links:- 
1) not preferred way to bring react in our project. 
2) by this we are calling another network call to bring react in our project.
3) if any new version came ,  so every time we need to change the URL to change the version.

Via NPM packages:-

Parcel:-
1) created the dev build
2) created the local server
3) doing HMR:- Hot Module Replacement
4) parcel uses the file watching algorithm(which is written in C++)
5) caching :- faster build
6) it will do image optimization
7) minification the file also(bundling)
8) compress the files
