what is react
what is crossorigin used in importing the files.

NPM:- is standard repository for all the packages, it's bigest package manager.
any package we need in our project we can use it.

Package.JSON:- it's configuration for npm, it's keep tracking of the version of all the packages installed in our application

package-lock.JSON:- it locks the vesrion ans keeps the record of the every/exact version of package/dependency

what is bundler:-
it's bundle your app, packages your app so that it can be shipped to the production

there are types of dependency we can install
1) Dev dependency :- it required at the development phase
2)Normal dependency :- used in production also

what is caret and tilde in package.JOSN
caret:- it will update automatically the minor version of the packages.
tilde:- it will update the major version automatically
to add exact version just remove the sign before the version


what is node modules:-
it contains the actuall data/code of the dependency of the packages which we installed 

npm :- to install the package.

npx:-
executing the package

we can bring react to our project via two ways:-
CDN Links:- 
1) not preferred way to bring react in our project. 
2) by this we are calling another network call to bring react in our project.
3) if any new version came ,  so every time we need to change the URL to change the version.

Via NPM packages:-

Parcel:- https://parceljs.org/docs/
- created the dev build
- created the local server
- doing HMR:- Hot Module Replacement
- parcel uses the file watching algorithm(which is written in C++)
- caching :- faster build
- it will do image optimization
- minification the file also(bundling)
- compress the files
- consistent hashing
- code splitting
- differential bundling:- to support in older browser as well
- Diagnostic
- Error Handling
- Tree Shaking - will remove unsuded code 
- different dev and Prod bundles
